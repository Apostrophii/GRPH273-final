What is the thing that jumps out at you the most (good or bad)?
Hm... it seems like something is missing somehow. At least on the mobile version. Can't put my finger on it though.

What is something you would change, and how would you change it?
I might give titles to the different projects being displayed.

What is the best thing about this design?
I really like the logo.

On a scale of 1â€“10 (1 being almost none, 10 being lots), how much effor do you think went into this design?
