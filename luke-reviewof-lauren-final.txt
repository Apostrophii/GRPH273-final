What is the thing that jumps out at you the most (good or bad)?
PINK!

What is something you would change, and how would you change it?
I might try to give the page a bit more clear organization? I'm not sure how to put my finger on it but sometimes it feels like the elements are kind of floating into each other.

What is the best thing about this design?
I quite like how simple the header is.

On a scale of 1â€“10 (1 being almost none, 10 being lots), how much effor do you think went into this design?
6
