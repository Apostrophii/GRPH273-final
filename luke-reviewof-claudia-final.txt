What is the thing that jumps out at you the most (good or bad)?
Looks very professional! Seriously, this is the kind of design I would easily expect to see "in the wild".

What is something you would change, and how would you change it?
Maybe rely a bit less on images? This is something I notice a lot about resturaunt sites, and it tends to make them load pretty slowly.

What is the best thing about this design?
At the same time I think that images were quite well incorperated. And in general I think that the design and layout is nice and bold.

On a scale of 1â€“10 (1 being almost none, 10 being lots), how much effor do you think went into this design?
